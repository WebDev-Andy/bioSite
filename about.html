    <h1 id="mainText">I met Natasha in Corvallis Oregon in the spring of 2013. From our first conversation together, I knew this was someone I wanted to get to know. She has many passions and projects that I love learning more about. She spent most of her twenties traveling, back-packing, staying on permaculture co-ops, learning homesteading skills and farming. She had just gotten back from Ecuador when we met and had many stories to tell. She helped her friend's family build an EcoHostel near Quito and then backpacked to the different cities and beaches. After that, she spent most of her time on the West Coast and started college. When she was a child, she wanted to wildlife conservationist. She is back in school now and going for a degree in just that, along with Natural Resource management. Growing up, she traveled a lot too and aside from most of the U.S., she visited Mexico and Canada. Her long term goals include finishing her degree and creating disaster resilient communities.  </h1>
